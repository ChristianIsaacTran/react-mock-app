# note to self

- after coming back to the odin project after christmas break, I tried to make a vite react project 
with the "npm create vite@latest someproject -- --template react", but I forgot that the name of the project 
cannot have capital letters due to npm's naming convention. Make sure when making future projects to not have any
capital letters in the project name.

# purpose of this repo

- this is going over the example assignment in the react mock components and callbacks section in the odin project.
